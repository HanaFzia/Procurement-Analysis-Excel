# Procurement-Analysis-Dashboard

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze procurement and supplier performance data using Microsoft Excel. The dataset simulates purchasing, supplier, and delivery transactions.

## Project Overview
- Which suppliers are high-risk based on delays, defects, and non-compliance?
- How much cost savings can be attributed to successful price negotiations?
- Which suppliers or categories have the highest policy violations?
- How do unit prices trend over time for different products or suppliers?

## Tools and Skills Used
- Microsoft Excel: Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers
- Formulas: IF, SUMIFS, VLOOKUP, DATE/TEXT functions
- Data Cleaning: Extracting Month-Year from dates, flagging delays, calculating savings
- Visualization: Interactive dashboards with slicers for category and supplier filtering

## Key Features
### Supplier Risk Analysis
- Flags vendors with frequent delivery delays and defects.
- Highlights high-risk suppliers based on historical performance.

### Cost Optimization
- Calculates total savings from negotiated prices versus standard unit prices.
- Shows top suppliers contributing to cost efficiency.

### Compliance Audit
- Breaks down the frequency of non-compliant transactions by supplier and category.
- Identifies areas that require policy reinforcement.

### Trend Forecasting
- Visualizes price trends across months and years, filtered by supplier or product category.
- Interactive slicer allows dynamic selection of products or suppliers.
